Main Axis: The flex-direction property defines the main axis and specifies along which direction the flex items are arranged. It is horizontal (row or row-reverse) or vertical (column or column-reverse).

Cross Axis: The cross axis is the opposite direction of the main axis. For a horizontal main axis (row or row-reverse), the cross axis will be vertical. For a vertical main axis (column or column-reverse), the cross axis will be horizontal.

Main Start and Main End: These are starting and ending points for the main axis. For row, main-start is to the left and main-end is to the right. For row-reverse, main-start is to the right and main-end is to the left. For column, main-start is at the top and main-end is at the bottom. For column-reverse, main-start is at the bottom and main-end is at the top.

Cross Start and Cross End: These are the beginning and terminus of the cross axis. For a horizontal main axis, cross-start is at the top and cross-end is at the bottom. For a vertical main axis, cross-start is on the left and cross-end is on the right.

Flex Direction Values: The property flex-direction contains four values: row (default), row-reverse, column, and column-reverse. These values specify the direction of the main axis.
